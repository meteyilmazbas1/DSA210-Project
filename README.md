## Climate Effects on Global Coffee Prices  

### Motivation  
One of the most traded agricultural products and a vital export for many tropical economies is coffee.  
 I chose this subject to research how environmental factors affect the volatility of the coffee market.  
 My objective is to determine whether coffee prices in producing nations are related to temperature and precipitation change.

### Research Questions  
How do temperature and rainfall changes in producer countries affect coffee production?   
Can we predict coffee price volatility using combined climate, production, and transportation variables?

### Hypothesis  
H₀: Coffee prices depend only on market forces and are not significantly affected by transport or production disruptions.  
H₁: Climate-related changes in production and disruptions in maritime transportation have a measurable and combined impact on coffee price volatility.
